# Code Refactor for Horiseon

## Description
Horiseon wanted a webpage that met accessibilty standards so that their own
webpage would be optimized for search engines.

## Work Done on HTML and CSS Files
* Semantic HTML elements were added to the HTML file to provide logical structure.
* Image elements within HTML file were given accessible alt attributes if needed.
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order.
* Title element was changed from just "webpage" to "Horiseon".
* Code in the CSS file was cleaned up to remove repetitive code and added general structure to CSS file.
